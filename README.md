# -FPGA-Quadcopter-Flight-Controller
The goal of this final project was to build a quadcopter flight-controller using an FPGA-based System-on-Chip architecture rather than a traditional microcontroller flight controller. Specifically, we implemented a MicroBlaze soft processor system in Vivado and designed multiple custom AXI-Lite peripherals to interface with quadcopter hardware.
